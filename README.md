# Dragon Curve

Welcome to the Dragon Curve repository! Explore the fascinating world of fractals and recursive patterns.

## Description

The Dragon Curve is a fractal generated by a recursive process known as the Heighway Dragon. It starts with a single line segment and iteratively replaces each segment with a specific pattern, resulting in a self-similar curve with intricate detail. The Dragon Curve exhibits fascinating properties such as infinite length and non-integer dimension.

For more information, you can refer to the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve).
